In the above files, the Decision tree regressor and classifiers are implemented!

The heart of decision trees lies in finding out the splitting criteria for which the impurity gap is used and the maximum is the best!

For classification, we use Gini Index as the objective function and for regression, we use mean squared error or mean absolute error as objective function!

Go on, open each notebook to find out further!
